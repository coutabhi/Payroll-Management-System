# **Payroll Management System**


## The Payroll Management System is a C++ project that can be used to do different things and store peopleâ€™s salary records, all without using SQL or a database, but only C++.

###### Payroll is the process by which workers get their paychecks. Payroll data needs to be balanced and matched up, and taxes need to be deposited and reported.

_The goal and scope of this project is to keep track of the different details and things that consumers do. It makes the work easier and cuts down on the amount of paper work. It lets the service provider store information about the customer and show the debits and credits that need to be made._

_It also lets the consumer details be changed and looked up. It gets around the problem of procedural programming by using the ideas of object-oriented programming. The project is a good example of how to use C++ to work with data files. The system makes sure that computers are error-free and easy to use._
